  from village ‘Jalbhe’, Jalandhar, Punjab, took an initiative to develop this
  website. The purpose of creating this is to connect our future generations to
  their roots and to rebuild fading connections among family. We are confident
  that our family will be able to learn about the history of their ancestors and
  receive the guidance that is very much needed. This is an attempt using the
  current technology to preserve our family’s history. We are convinced and
  satisfied that this initiative will be beneficial to the ‘Hundal’ family and
  everyone else. Without any hesitation, we admit that there are many
  shortcomings in this endeavor. We urge you to make a full use of this website
  and help us with suggestions to improve and enrich it."

The term often overlapped with heraldry, in which the ancestry of royalty was reflected in their coats of arms.</p>
